### _General rules for assignments in Software Engineering PS_

* Begin your work by carefully reading the text below as well as the starter code in `src/main/java`, including the comments therein.
* You are expected to:
    * Add code to classes and methods in the starter code, in particular everything marked with `TODO`, and more.
	* Change/add implementation to starter methods. In particular, change dummy return values.
* You may add to starter classes: new attributes and methods, inheritance (super- or subclasses), and inner classes (if really needed).
* You may add your own packages and classes but only in the root package of the assignment:`src/main/java` . Note that every new class file must start with a package declaration
* Regarding the starter code, please make sure **not** to:
	* rename the root package
    * rename classes and their access modifiers 
    * change method signatures
    * modify the contents of the `.github` folder and `pom.xml` file.
* Java version: 14
* **Important: if at least one of the above rules is not satisfied, one or all tests may fail and points may be lost!**
* It is normal at the beginning to have compiler errors in the test code, or otherwise failed tests, since the starter code does not satisfy requirements of the assignment.
